# Bike_Sales
This project involved an in-depth analysis of a customer dataset to uncover key insights influencing bike purchase behavior. As the Data Analyst, my objective was to understand customer demographics, preferences, and regional trends to drive data-backed sales strategies.

My Role: Data Analyst

Tools Used: Excel

Approach & Impact:
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of 1000 customer records, segmenting buyers by car ownership, commute distance, income bracket, age, and geographic region. Key insights revealed that our strongest bike purchasers are typically middle-aged customers in the low to mid-income brackets, owning 0-2 cars, and having short commutes (0-1 mile). North America also emerged as our top sales region.

Leveraging these findings, I developed actionable recommendations aimed at optimizing marketing efforts and product offerings. These insights are crucial for refining target customer segments, enhancing sales strategies, and identifying significant growth opportunities within the bike sales market. The project provided a clear roadmap to increase sales efficiency and customer engagement.
